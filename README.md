You can run front end or client using Live Server in VS code 
I have used socket io here 
In client.js is the main JS file as well as client side code 
In Index.js is the main file for server side code 
To run server using node js 
type cd nodeServer
then nodemon index.js 
Then the real time group chat app will be ready and working
